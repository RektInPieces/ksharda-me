summary = "From one of my first attended hackathons, we tried to create a voice-activated chatbot that could "replace" something like Siri or Alexa. Of course, it wasn't that successful, but was a pretty fun experience. This won second place at LexHack. A completely recreated iteration of it won third place at HackNEHS."
