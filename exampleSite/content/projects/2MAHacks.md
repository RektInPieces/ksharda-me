summary = "MAHacks is one the largest and longest standing hackathons in the New England area. For MAHacks V, our team raised more than $15,000 while attracting more than 100 attendees. I was in charge of sponsorships and helped with mentors. We saw amazing projects culminate out of a 24 hour period at the Rapid7 venue, including a robot that assisted workshop workers and a system that automatically refilled dog food at certain times."
