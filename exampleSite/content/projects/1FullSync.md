summary = "A fix to better-onetab by Wangjie. This project is really about creating an extension that I would use, which would let Chrome/Chromium or Firefox users store and sync tabs across devices as well as non-encrypted form data if possible. This ultimately leads to less tab memory usage and better storage."
