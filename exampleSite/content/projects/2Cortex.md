summary = "Cortex enables a decentralized manner of identity management. The web application provides a simple onboarding experience via Fortmatic & Torus, and users can then easily prove online identities to link them together (e.g. website presences, email address, social media profiles). This effectively creates a decentralized web of trust, backed by proofs to well-known identities — for example, the credentials of a researcher at MIT could be attested to by the Ethereum account of MIT’s presence on Cortex, which itself would be tied to an HTTPS web proof of mit.edu. This won the Torus and ENS awards at EthWaterloo."
