summary = "I was fairly excited about giving this talk as it is about something I truly think is valuable to both entrepreneurship and how we approach technolgies. It focuses on trying to define problems and their solutions without relying on the so-called hype of a technology to carry it through. I personally believe that this methodology, instead of the one that had sweeped through Silicon Valley in 2018, is much better."
