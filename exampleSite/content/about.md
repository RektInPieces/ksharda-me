**Hi, I'm Kunal! I enjoy building, writing, and presenting anything that comes to mind. This blog allows me to share my thoughts and (almost all of) my projects. I am an incoming student at Carnegie Mellon 2X and intend to study Business + Computer Science. 

Currently, most of my time goes towards building [Delphus](https://delph.us/), but some of my other work can be found on the [Projects Page](https://ksharda.me/projects/).**

## H2 2020 Plans 

Under construction!
