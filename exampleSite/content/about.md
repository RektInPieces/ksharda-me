Hi, I'm Kunal! I enjoy talking theory, discussing code (or, more accurately, complaining about JS), and working through random ideas. This blog allows me to share my thoughts and (almost all of) my projects. I am an incoming student at Carnegie Mellon 2X and intend to study Business Administration + Computer Science. 

Currently, most of my time goes towards building [Delphus](https://delph.us/), but some of my other work can be found on the [Projects Page](https://ksharda.me/projects/).

I am generally interested in these strangely specific areas, but I love to talk about almost anything:
- Public Policy and Technology 
- Art and Books/History (Especially interested in Asian subcontinent history right now)
- Scientific research and making it better
- Food and Travel 
- Other people's philosophy and how it relates to making their life better

## H2 2020 Plans 

Under construction!
